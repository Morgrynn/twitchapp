# Twitch App
---

A web app using React and Redux.
Project is using the [twitch api](https://dev.twitch.tv).

Using OAuth to sign in and access a CRUD application and set up an API server.

---

### Problems

1. Google OAuth has error
2. Search bar function only worked correctly in react only version of the app.
3. The twitch api was difficult to get live streams to show.

These are some of the major issues I have faced.
